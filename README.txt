4.1 The Game
The game is a perfect clone with graphic and music from the original game. The 70 first levels are redesigned in Tiled (http://www.mapeditor.org/) and are exactly designed as the originals.
To add more levels to the game, copy and modify the levelEmpty.tmx found in data/levels and rename your new level level71.tmx. You can edit levels as you want with the map editor Tiled and the tileset is added in the same directory named tileset.png.
